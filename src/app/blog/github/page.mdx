### Undo Last Commit

If you’ve committed changes in Git but haven’t pushed them yet, you have a few ways to "uncommit" depending on whether you want to keep the changes or discard them.

### **1. Undo the last commit but keep the changes (soft reset)**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- This will **remove the last commit** but keep your changes staged (ready to be committed again).

---

### **2. Undo the last commit and unstage the changes (mixed reset)**

```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```

- This removes the last commit **and unstages** the changes, but your modified files remain in your working directory.

---

### **3. Undo the last commit and discard all changes (hard reset)**

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

- ⚠ **Warning:** This will **delete the commit and all changes** in the working directory. Only use this if you're sure you don't need the changes.

---

### **4. Undo multiple commits**

If you want to undo **the last 2 commits**, replace `HEAD~1` with `HEAD~2`:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~2
```

(Replace `2` with however many commits you want to undo.)

---

### **5. If you already pushed the commit (Force Push)**

If you've already pushed the commit and want to undo it:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force
```

```bash
 git commit --date="" -m ""
```

### Ignore Files

```bash
touch .gitignore
```
